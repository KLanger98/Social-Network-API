# Social-Network-API

## Description
The following project has been completed as a part of the Adelaide University Web Development Bootcamp. By creating this project I have been able to familiarise myself wit noSQL databases including MongoDB. To do this I have created a 'Social Network API' which allows for the Creation of Users and Thoughts and their associated reactions and list of friends. 

Mongoose's Object Data Modelling framework was especially helpful for designing the models required for this project.

Please view the following video demonstrating how to use this application:


## Installation
If you would like to install this project on your local computer, simply clone the repository to your local.

Using your selected code editor, use 'npm i' to install all necessary packages.

You can then run the server with 'node server.js'

## Usage
Please refer to the following video for a demonstration of how to make Create, Read, Update and Delete requests to the server:

Once your server is running you will be able to make the following API calls:
- Thoughts - Create, Read, Update and Delete 
- User - Create, Read, Update and Delete
- Reactions - Create and Delete 
- Friends - Create and Delete
